# Project_SLC_DSBA_INNHotels
Through this project, I deepened my ability to translate raw data into concrete business value. I cleaned and engineered features that captures booking behavior, handled class-imbalance in cancellation labels, and evaluated multiple algorithms before utilizing a gradient-boosting model that flags likely cancellations with strong precision and recall. I turned model outputs into deliverable insights for a company.
